# Build a Traffic Sign Recognition Classifier with 98% Accuracy

![icon_image](./images/softmax_probability.png)

This project presents a deep learning architecture that can identify traffic signs with close to 98% accuracy on the test set. We start from building a simple CNN model, and later on apply different image processing techniques such as Grayscale Conversion, Normalisation, Histogram Equalization and Data Augmentation to see how they can enhance the model's performance. Along the way, we also try out several Dropout values to imporove the model's accuracy on test set.


The project is divided into three parts. In the first part, we explore and get a summarization of the input dataset. The second part focuses on designing and testing the model architecture using different CNN configurations, Dropout Values and Image Processing techniques. In the final section, we test the most outstanding model on the new images and analyze the prediction performance.

# I. Load and Explore the Dataset <a name="1"></a>
## 1. Load the data <a name="2"></a>


```python
datasets_path = "./datasets/german_traffic_signs/"
models_path = "./models/"

training_file = datasets_path + 'train.p'
validation_file = datasets_path + 'valid.p'
testing_file = datasets_path + 'test.p'

with open(training_file, mode='rb') as f:
    train = pickle.load(f)
with open(validation_file, mode='rb') as f:
    valid = pickle.load(f)
with open(testing_file, mode='rb') as f:
    test = pickle.load(f)
    
X_train, y_train = train['features'], train['labels']
X_valid, y_valid = valid['features'], valid['labels']
X_test, y_test = test['features'], test['labels']

```

## 2. Dataset Exploration and Summary <a name="3"></a>
The pickled data is a dictionary with 4 key/value pairs:

   * 'features' is a 4D array containing raw pixel data of the traffic sign images, (num examples, width, height, channels).
   * 'labels' is a 1D array containing the label/class id of the traffic sign. The file signnames.csv contains id -> name mappings for each id.
   * 'sizes' is a list containing tuples, (width, height) representing the original width and height the image.
   * 'coords' is a list containing tuples, (x1, y1, x2, y2) representing coordinates of a bounding box around the sign in the image. **THESE COORDINATES ASSUME THE ORIGINAL IMAGE. THE PICKLED DATA CONTAINS RESIZED VERSIONS (32 by 32) OF THESE IMAGES**



```python
# Let's get some dimensions
print("Features shape: ", X_train.shape)
print("Labels shape: ", y_train.shape)
```

    Features shape:  (34799, 32, 32, 3)
    Labels shape:  (34799,)



```python
# Number of training examples
n_train = X_train.shape[0]

# Number of validatation examples
n_validation = X_valid.shape[0]

# Number of testing examples
n_test = X_test.shape[0]

# What's the shape of an traffic sign image
image_shape = X_train.shape[1:]

# How many unique classes/labels in the datasets
n_classes = len(set(y_train))

print("Number of training examples =", n_train)
print("Number of validation examples =", n_validation)
print("Number of testing examples =", n_test)
print("Image data shape =", image_shape)
print("Number of classes =", n_classes)
```

    Number of training examples = 34799
    Number of validation examples = 4410
    Number of testing examples = 12630
    Image data shape = (32, 32, 3)
    Number of classes = 43


### Group images by classes <a name="4"></a>
We leverage on the pandas module to group the images by label. Our first step is to import the signnames.csv file which contains English description of the labels.


```python
# Load the sign names file
sign_names = pd.read_csv("signnames.csv")
sign_names.set_index("ClassId")

sign_names.head(n=5)
```

We can already witness significant data imbalance across the classes in the training. For instance class 0 has less than 200 images, 
while class 2 has over 2000 images. Let's plot the number of images against the class to better understand visually where we stand.

```

This confirms the significant class imbalance we observed earlier. At this stage we will not attempt to address it.

```python
# Let's plot images from each of these classes
X_train_group_by_label = X_train_id_to_label.groupby(["label_id", "label_name"])
img_per_class = 5
show_random_datasets_images(X_train_group_by_label, X_train)
```

## 3. Create a sample set <a name="13"></a>
As we have over 30 thousand images, we do not want to try every model on the whole dataset as this would be extremely time consuming. 
Instead, we create sample datasets for training and validation, where we copy a percentage P of both dataset.


```python
X_sample_train, y_sample_train = create_sample_set(X_train_group_by_label, X_train, y_train, pct = 0.33)
print("Sample training images dimension={0}, label dimensions={1}".format(X_sample_train.shape, y_sample_train.shape))

X_sample_valid, y_sample_valid = create_sample_set(X_valid_group_by_label, X_valid, y_valid, pct=0.33)
print("Sample validation images dimensions={0}, labels dimensions={1}".format(X_sample_valid.shape, y_sample_valid.shape))
```

    Sample training images dimension=(11464, 32, 32, 3), label dimensions=(11464,)
    Sample validation images dimensions=(1427, 32, 32, 3), labels dimensions=(1427,)


# II. Design and Test a Model Architecture <a name="14"></a>
Design and implement a deep learning model that learns to recognize traffic signs. Train and test model on the German Traffic Sign Dataset.

There are various aspects to consider when thinking about this problem:

    Neural network architecture (is the network over or underfitting?)
    Play around preprocessing techniques (normalization, rgb to grayscale, etc)
    Number of examples per label (some have more than others).
    Generate fake data.

## 1. Data Pre-Processing <a name="15"></a>

Minimally, the image data should be normalized so that the data has mean zero and equal variance. For image data, (pixel - 128)/ 128 is a quick way to approximately normalize the data and can be used in this project.

### Normalisation <a name="16"></a>


```python
# Normalize training set
X_train_normalised = normalise_images(X_train, X_train)
```


```python
# Do the same for training and validatiaon set 
X_valid_normalised = normalise_images(X_valid, X_train)
X_test_normalised = normalise_images(X_test, X_train)
```


```python
show_random_datasets_images(X_valid_group_by_label, X_valid_normalised)

We can see that grascalling somewhat improves teh visibility of the images, but some of them
still remain very dark. At this stage we will not address this problem


```python
# Do the same on validation set
X_valid_grayscale = np.asarray(list(map(lambda img: to_grayscale(img), X_valid)))
# show_random_datasets_images(X_valid_group_by_label, X_valid_grayscale)
```


```python
# Also grayscale test data
X_test_grayscale = np.asarray(list(map(lambda img: to_grayscale(img), X_test)))
# show_image_list(X_test_grayscale[10:13], y_test[10:13], "Gray image", cols=3, fig_size=(3, 3), show_ticks=False)

```

## 2. Model Architectures <a name="18"></a>

In this section, we will create a configurable neural network architectures where the number of layers as well as filter sizes can be modified. But first, we set up the pipeline to enable us to achieve our goal.

### Configuration and Execution pipeline <a name="19"></a>

We define the steps necessary to build a training pipeline in Tensorflow. These are defined as classes to increase flexibility.

Interesting, the 5x5 model is the one that shows the most overfit, and produces significantly higher losses than the 3x3 model. This could be due to the fact that we have a deeper network that uses less coarse convolutions and therefore is able to extract more features. We are next going to test the model on grayscale images.

Once again, the 3x3 model outperforms the 5x5 one on validation and test accuracy. We can see that both models' validation losses are increasing as the training accuracy improves. This is a strong suggestion that overfitting is occuring.

We are seeing some great results with the introduction of dropout. The 5x5 model achieves above 96% accuracy while the 3x3 model achieves over 97% test accuracy. We should get similar, if not better results, with grayscale images.

Once again, both 3x3 and 5x5 variants are very close, accuracy-wise on all dataset types. Interestingly, the 3x3 model achieves lower accuracy than its counterpart 3x3 model on color images. We should do more runs of those models to determine which one performs better over the long run in the future. But We believe that we don't need to go that far: we can use even more aggressive dropout values to obtain better results.

Both models show smooth, satisfying on the curves. The 3x3 model clearly seems to perform the best. While we are able to score above 98% accuracy on vaidation set, we have not been able to break through this barrier yet on the test set, but we are close!

Color and grayscale images exhibit very similar behaviour, with maybe the advantage for grayscale, lower losses on test accuracy. At this stage we are unable to pick between grayscale or color for the input images since we obtain very similar results in both cases. Maybe color is not much of an issue in fact if the model performs so well on grayscale images? We will next turn to augmenting images and explore whether we can reach better results by randomly applying distortions to our images.

## 4. Histogram Equalization <a name="35"></a>

We observed earlier that some of the images in the dataset were quite dark, and others blurry. We are aiming at taclking this problem in this part where we attempt to apply histogram equalization techniques to improve the contrast of our images and therefore make it easier for our model to discern which class the supplied image ultimately belongs to with a higher level of confidence. To do so, we are going to rely on OpenCV's CLAHE (Contrast Limiting Adaptive Histogram Equalization) function.


```python
g_img = np.reshape(X_train_grayscale[15796], (32, 32))
plt.imshow(g_img, cmap='gray')
```




    <matplotlib.image.AxesImage at 0x7f508966edd8>




![png](./images/output_99_1.png)



```python
clahe = cv2.createCLAHE(tileGridSize=(4,4), clipLimit=40.0)
cl1 = clahe.apply(g_img)
plt.imshow(cl1, cmap='gray')
```




    <matplotlib.image.AxesImage at 0x7f5089657320>




![png](./images/output_100_1.png)



```python
clahe = cv2.createCLAHE(tileGridSize=(2,2), clipLimit=15.0)
cl2 = clahe.apply(g_img)
plt.imshow(cl2, cmap='gray')
show_image_list([g_img, cl1, cl2], ["L0", "L1", "L2"], "", cols=3, fig_size=(8,8), show_ticks=False)
```

We choose CLAHE with grid size of 2x2 and climit limit of 15


```python
X_train_grayscale_equalized = np.asarray(list(map(lambda img: clahe.apply(np.reshape(img, (32,32))), 
                                                  X_train_grayscale)))

X_test_grayscale_equalized = np.asarray(list(map(lambda img: clahe.apply(np.reshape(img, (32, 32))),
                                                 X_test_grayscale)))
```


```python

The 3x3 model performs better, topping 93% test accuracy, but we can see on the graph of Loss vs Epochs that our models losses increase as the epochs go by, which would indicate that we are overfitting and no working hard enough to extract features that generalise. We will try applying aggressive dropout values, with the hope that this helps alleviate the loss and improve the accuracy.

#### Normalised images With Dropout <a name="38"></a>

We apply our best model with two levels of dropout (p-conv=0.5, p-fc=0.5)) and (p-conv=0.6, p-fc=0.5) on normalised histogram-equalised image

### Analysis of 3x3 Model performance <a name="39"></a>



```python
test_preds = me_g_clahe_norm_take2_drpt_0_50_3x3.predict(X_test_grayscale_equalized_normalised)

```

    INFO:tensorflow:Restoring parameters from ./models/EdLeNet_Grayscale_CLAHE_Norm_Take-2_3x3_Dropout_0.50.chkpt



```python
good_test_preds = test_preds == y_test
bad_test_preds = test_preds != y_test
```


```python
bad_test_pred_imgs = X_test_grayscale_equalized[bad_test_preds]
good_test_pred_imgs = X_test_grayscale_equalized[good_test_preds]
bad_test_pred_correct_lb = y_test[bad_test_preds]
bad_test_pred_incorrect_lb = test_preds[bad_test_preds]
```


```python
print("Number of good predictions: {0}/{1}".format(len(good_test_pred_imgs), len(y_test)))
print("Number of bad predictions: {0}/{1}".format(len(bad_test_pred_imgs), len(y_test)))
```

    Number of good predictions: 12340/12630
    Number of bad predictions: 290/12630


We have 290 images where our prediction was incorrect. Let's visualize some of them to better understand what's going on.


```python
count =10
idx = np.random.randint(0, high=len(bad_test_pred_imgs), size=10)
show_image_list(bad_test_pred_imgs[idx], bad_test_pred_incorrect_lb, "Bad test predictions", cols = count)
```


![png](./images/output_126_0.png)


Some of the images are very blurry, despite our histogram equalization, while others seem distorted. We turn to data augmentation to address these isssues.

## 5. Data Augmentation <a name="40"></a>

We observed earlier that the data presented glaring imbalance across the 43 classes. Yet it does not seem to be a crippling problem as we are able to reach very high accuracy despite the class imbalance. We also noticed that some images in the test set are distorted. We are therefore going to use data augmentation techniques in an attempt to:

   1. Minimize imbalances across classes
   2. Extend dataset and provide additional pictures in different lighting settings and orientations
   3. Improve model's ability to become more generic
   4. Improve test and validation accuracy, especially on distorted images




```python
X_train_augs = X_train
y_train_augs = y_train
```


```python
# This loop augments images per label group
for (lid, lbl), group in X_train_group_by_label:
    #print((lid, lbl))
    #print(group)
    group_count = group['img_id'].size
    idx = group['img_id'].values
    imgs = X_train[idx]
    
    
    # Take a different population of the subset depending on how many images we have already
    # and vary the number of augmentations depending on size of label group
    pt_spacing = 1.0
    p = 1.0
    n = group_count * 0.1 # augment 10% of the images in that label group
    
    if group_count > 500 and group_count < 1000:
        pt_spacing = 3.0
    elif group_count >= 1000 and group_count < 2000:
        pt_spacing = 10.0
        
    elif group_count >= 2000:
        pt_spacing = 20.0
        
    n = int(n)
    
    space_interval = int(group_count / pt_spacing)
    rand_idx = np.linspace(0, group_count, num=space_interval, endpoint=False, dtype='int')
    selected_rows = group.iloc[rand_idx]
    selected_img = np.array(list(map(lambda img_id: X_train[img_id], selected_rows['img_id'])))
    augs = augment_imgs_until_n(selected_img, n, p)
    X_train_augs = np.concatenate((X_train_augs, augs)) # Add the augmented training images to the original training images
    y_train_augs = np.concatenate((y_train_augs, np.repeat(lid, n))) # Add labels to augmented training images

print("Original training array shape: {0} and {1}".format(X_train.shape, y_train.shape))
print("New Augmented array shape: {0} and {1}".format(X_train_augs.shape, y_train_augs.shape))
```

    Original training array shape: (34799, 32, 32, 3) and (34799,)
    New Augmented array shape: (38278, 32, 32, 3) and (38278,)


Let's see the distribution and visualize some random images from the new augmented set: 


```python
X_train_augs_id_to_label = group_img_id_to_lbl(y_train_augs, sign_names)
X_train_augs_group_by_label_count = group_img_id_to_lb_count(X_train_augs_id_to_label)

# Now count the number of images for each class and plot the results so taht we understand the distribution
X_train_augs_group_by_label_count.plot(kind='bar', figsize=(15,7), title="Image distribution across labels \
in Augmented Dataset")
```




    <matplotlib.axes._subplots.AxesSubplot at 0x7f506c4b2a20>




![png](./images/output_132_1.png)


We have managed to mitigate the gaping imbalance we originally observed, but it is still painfully obvious. We decided to temper our augmentation ambitions as we did not want the model to overwhelmingly learn about augmented images, to the detriment of real images. That's a hard balance to strike in all fairness but we believe we have some interesting results. Now every class has at least 10% of its dataset augmented. Our assumption is that our network should now perform better. Let's put it to the test. The below shows visuals of the new dataset, with some images having been augmented by the steps above.


```python
# Let's plot images from each of these classes
X_train_augs_group_by_label = X_train_augs_id_to_label.groupby(["label_id", "label_name"])
show_random_datasets_images(X_train_augs_group_by_label, X_train_augs)
```

### Evaluating model on augmented dataset  <a name="42"></a>

For this part, we will focus exclusively on grayscale images as they seem to produce better performance. Color images may exhibit close performance but as we plan to also apply histogram equalization the images must be in grayscale.

#### Grayscale Augmented Dataset  <a name="42"></a>


```python
# First convert to grayscale
X_train_augs_grayscale = np.asarray(list(map(lambda img: to_grayscale(img), X_train_augs)))
```


```python
# Then histogram equalize the grayscale images
X_train_augs_grayscale_equalized = \
np.asarray(list(map(lambda img: clahe.apply(np.reshape(img,(32,32))), X_train_augs_grayscale)))
```


```python
# Now normalise using the mean and std of the training set
X_train_augs_grayscale_equalized_normalised = \
normalise_images(X_train_augs_grayscale_equalized, X_train_augs_grayscale_equalized)
X_valid_augs_grayscale_equalized_normalised = \
normalise_images(X_valid_grayscale_equalized, X_train_augs_grayscale_equalized)
X_test_augs_grayscale_equalized_normalised = \
normalise_images(X_test_grayscale_equalized, X_train_augs_grayscale_equalized)
```


```python
# Reshaping our inputs to a format that tensorflow accepts (i.e. a 4D tensor)
X_train_augs_grayscale_equalized_normalised = \
np.reshape(X_train_augs_grayscale_equalized_normalised, (X_train_augs_grayscale_equalized_normalised.shape[0], 32, 32, 1))
X_valid_augs_grayscale_equalized_normalised = \
np.reshape(X_valid_augs_grayscale_equalized_normalised, (X_valid_augs_grayscale_equalized_normalised.shape[0], 32, 32, 1))
X_test_augs_grayscale_equalized_normalised = \
np.reshape(X_test_augs_grayscale_equalized_normalised,   (X_test_augs_grayscale_equalized_normalised.shape[0], 32, 32, 1))

The model *EdLeNet_Augs_Grayscale_CLAHE_Norm_TAKE3_3x3_Dropout_0.50* gives us our best results to date, with a test accuracy of **97.5%** and test loss less than 0.1. Because the loss on the training and validation sets is still high, it indicates that we most likely still have room for manoeuvre, and should therefore run the model for more epochs. Therefore, we will have the current results and re-run the model for twice as many epochs and then observe results.

# III. Test Model on New Images  <a name="50"></a>

In this section, we use new images of German traffic signs, downloaded from the Internet, to run the model's prediction against. We then visualize the top 5 softmax probabilites and finally, show what the model's activation layers look like for the supplied images.

## 1. Load and Output the Images <a name="51"></a>


```python
from PIL import Image
import os

def get_imgs_from_folder(path, size=(32,32), grayscale=False):
    """
    Return a list of images from a folder as a numpy array
    """
    img_list = [os.path.join(path, f) for f in os.listdir(path) if f.endswith(".jpg") or f.endswith(".png")]
    imgs = None
    if grayscale:
        imgs = np.empty([len(img_list), size[0], size[1]], dtype=np.uint8)
    else:
        imgs = np.empty([len(img_list), size[0], size[1], 3], dtype=np.uint8)
        
    for i, img_path in enumerate(img_list):
        img = Image.open(img_path).convert('RGB')
        img = img.resize(size)
        img = np.array(to_grayscale(img)) if grayscale else np.array(img)
        imgs[i] = img
        
    return imgs      
    
    
```


```python
new_imgs_dir = "./custom_images/"
```


```python
new_imgs = get_imgs_from_folder(new_imgs_dir)
new_imgs.shape
```




    (5, 32, 32, 3)




```python
new_imgs_grayscale_clahe = np.asarray(list(map(lambda img: clahe.apply(to_grayscale(img)), new_imgs)))
```


```python
def class_ids_to_labels(cids):
    return list(map(lambda cid: sign_names[sign_names["ClassId"] == cid] ["SignName"].values[0], cids))
```


```python
# Let's also create the labels for our images
# new_img_lbs = np.array([8, 12, 15, 25, 16])
new_img_lbs = np.array([12, 25, 8, 15, 16])
```


```python
new_img_lbs_text = class_ids_to_labels(new_img_lbs)
new_img_lbs_text
```




    ['Priority road',
     'Road work',
     'Speed limit (120km/h)',
     'No vehicles',
     'Vehicles over 3.5 metric tons prohibited']




```python
show_image_list(new_imgs, new_img_lbs_text, "New Traffic Sign Images (Color)", cols=len(new_imgs),
               fig_size=(6,6), show_ticks=False)
```


![png](./images/output_167_0.png)



```python
show_image_list(new_imgs_grayscale_clahe, new_img_lbs_text, "New Traffic Sign Images (Grayscale)", 
                cols=len(new_imgs_grayscale_clahe), fig_size=(6,6), show_ticks=False)
```


![png](./images/output_168_0.png)


The images are chosen because of the following:

   * They represent different traffic signs that we currently classify
   * They vary in shape and color
   * They are under different lighting conditions (the 4th one has sunlight reflection)
   * They are under different orientations (the 3rd one is slanted)
   * They have different background
   * The last image is actually a design, not a real picture, and we wanted to test the model against it to see if it recognizes it
   * Some of them are in under-represented classes
   
## 2. Predicting the Sign Type for Each Image <a name="52"></a>


```python
# First normalise the images
new_img_grayscale_clahe_normalised = normalise_images(new_imgs_grayscale_clahe, X_train_grayscale_equalized)
```


```python
# Convert to a format Tensorflow understands
new_img_grayscale_clahe_normalised = np.reshape(new_img_grayscale_clahe_normalised, 
                                                (new_img_grayscale_clahe_normalised.shape[0], 32, 32, 1))
```


```python
# Let's run the predictions now
preds = me_g_augs_clahe_norm_take3_drpt_0_50_3x3.predict(new_img_grayscale_clahe_normalised)
```

    INFO:tensorflow:Restoring parameters from ./models/EdLeNet_Augs_Grayscale_CLAHE_Norm_Take3_3x3_Dropout_0.50.chkpt



```python
preds
```




    array([12, 25,  8, 15, 16])



## 3. Analyze Prediction Performance <a name="53"></a>

### Calculating accuracy <a name="54"></a>


```python
new_img_grayscale_norm_pred_acc = np.sum(new_img_lbs == preds) / len(preds)
print("[Grayscale Normalised] Predictional accuracy on new images: {0}%".format(new_img_grayscale_norm_pred_acc*100))

```

    [Grayscale Normalised] Predictional accuracy on new images: 100.0%


We achieve perfect accuracy of 100% on the new images. On the original test set, we achieved 97.5% accuracy. 

Next we will explore the distribution of our top 5 Softmax probabilites for each image and will plot them.

### Calculating Top 5 Softmax Probabilites <a name="55"></a>


```python
new_img_grayscale_clahe_norm_top5_probs = me_g_augs_clahe_norm_drpt_0_50_3x3.predict(
    new_img_grayscale_clahe_normalised, top_5=True)
```

    INFO:tensorflow:Restoring parameters from ./models/EdLeNet_Augs_Grayscale_CLAHE_Norm_3x3_Dropout_0.50.chkpt



```python

                                                         new_img_grayscale_clahe_norm_top5_probs.indices))
```


```python

```python

```




    (array([1.0000000e+00, 6.8846941e-18, 6.6979367e-20, 1.4074748e-22,

      'Speed limit (60km/h)'])



### Visualize Our Softmax Probabilites <a name="56"></a>
We show each new images next to its computed 5 softmax probabilities. The bars in green indicates the ground truth label


```python
def show_imgs_softmax_probs(imgs, softmax_probs_lb_names, correct_lbs, fig_size=(15,7)):
    rows = len(imgs)
    fg, ax = plt.subplots(nrows=rows, ncols=2, figsize=fig_size)
    for i, prob_lb in enumerate(softmax_probs_lb_names):
        correct_lb = correct_lbs[i]
        img = imgs[i]
        ax[i,0].imshow(img)
        ax[i,0].axis("off")
        
        lb_names = prob_lb[1]
        y_pos = np.arange(len(lb_names))
        vals = prob_lb[0]
        for j in range(0, len(lb_names)):
            c = "g" if lb_names[j] == correct_lb else "r"
            ax[i, 1].barh(j, vals[j], color=c, label="{0}".format(lb_names[j]))
            
        ax[i,1].set_yticks(y_pos)
        ax[i,1].set_yticklabels(lb_names)
        ax[i,1].invert_yaxis() # labels read top-on-bottom
        ax[i,1].set_xlabel('Class')
        ax[i,1].set_title('Softmax')
        ax[i,1].set_xscale('log')
        
        ax[i,1].legend(loc='lower right')
        
    fg.tight_layout()
    plt.show()
```


```python
show_imgs_softmax_probs(new_imgs, new_img_grayscale_clahe_norm_softmax_and_labels,
                       new_img_lbs_text, fig_size=(15,20))
```


![png](./images/output_185_0.png)


We can clearly see that our model quite confident in its predictions. In the worst case, which is the last image, the most likely prediction has a probability of around 10<sup>-5</sup>. This is probably because the image is actually not even a real picture. Overall, we have developed a strong model.

## 4. Visualizing feature maps <a name="57"></a>

While neural networks can be a great learning device they are often referred to as a black box. We can understand what the weights of a neural network look like better by plotting their feature maps. After successfully training your neural network you can see what it's feature maps look like by plotting the output of the network's weight layers in response to a test stimuli image. From these plotted feature maps, it's possible to see what characteristics of an image the network finds interesting. For a sign, maybe the inner network feature maps react with high activation to the sign's boundary outline or to the contrast in the sign's painted symbol.



```python
selected_new_img = np.reshape(new_imgs_grayscale_clahe[2], (32, 32, 1))
```


```python
me_g_augs_clahe_norm_take3_drpt_0_50_3x3.show_conv_feature_map(selected_new_img, conv_layer_idx=0, 
                                                           fig_size=(20,10), title_y_pos=1)
```

    INFO:tensorflow:Restoring parameters from ./models/EdLeNet_Augs_Grayscale_CLAHE_Norm_Take3_3x3_Dropout_0.50.chkpt
    Fetching tensor: EdLeNet_Augs_Grayscale_CLAHE_Norm_Take3_3x3_Dropout_0.50/conv_0_relu:0
    Shape of activation layer: (1, 30, 30, 32)



![png](./images/output_188_1.png)


We can see that the network is focusing a lot on the edges of the circle and somehow on the 120. The background is ignored.


```python
me_g_augs_clahe_norm_take3_drpt_0_50_3x3.show_conv_feature_map(selected_new_img, conv_layer_idx=1, 
                                                           fig_size=(20,10), title_y_pos=1)
```

    INFO:tensorflow:Restoring parameters from ./models/EdLeNet_Augs_Grayscale_CLAHE_Norm_Take3_3x3_Dropout_0.50.chkpt
    Fetching tensor: EdLeNet_Augs_Grayscale_CLAHE_Norm_Take3_3x3_Dropout_0.50/conv_1_relu:0
    Shape of activation layer: (1, 13, 13, 64)



![png](./images/output_190_1.png)


It is rather hard to determine what the network is focusing on in layer 1, but it seems to "activate" around the edges of the circle and in the middle, where our 120 is printed.


```python
me_g_augs_clahe_norm_take3_drpt_0_50_3x3.show_conv_feature_map(selected_new_img, conv_layer_idx=2, 
                                                           fig_size=(20,10), title_y_pos=1)
```

    INFO:tensorflow:Restoring parameters from ./models/EdLeNet_Augs_Grayscale_CLAHE_Norm_Take3_3x3_Dropout_0.50.chkpt
    Fetching tensor: EdLeNet_Augs_Grayscale_CLAHE_Norm_Take3_3x3_Dropout_0.50/conv_2_relu:0
    Shape of activation layer: (1, 4, 4, 128)



![png](./images/output_192_1.png)


This activation map is also hard to decipher... But it seems the network reacts to stimuli on the edges and in the middle once again.

## 5. Future Improvement <a name="58"></a>

While we have obtained very good results, we believe that we can achieve even better performance in the future by testing more hyperparameter variations (e.g. dimensions of fully connected layers) as well as exploring novel ANN architectures such as GoogLeNet's Inception Module, Resnet, or Xception. 


```python

```
